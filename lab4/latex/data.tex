\subsection{Standard Downward Characteristics}
$R_B = 10.16 \Omega$\\
$R_C = 287.7 \Omega$\\
Here we will study $I_C$ vs $V_{BE}$ characteristics and $\beta$ versus $I_C$ characteristics.

\subsection{Upwards Operation}

Here we look at the upwards gain of transistor 1 as a function of voltage.

\subsection{Base Resistance}

Total Resistance between X and Y in pattern 1 is: $5.021 k \Omega$

Total Resistance between X and Y in pattern 2 is: $61.7 k \Omega$


\subsection{Lateral \textit{pnp} Devices}


We can measure the gain of the lateral pnp transistor by taking the current values of $I_B$ = 0.1007 mA \& $I_C$ = 1.0460 mA at values of $V_CE$ = -1.50 V. This gives a gain of 10.4526. \\

 %\& $V_BE$ = -0.655

We can also measure the gain of the lateral pnp transistor where the outer p diffusion is used as an emitter and the center p diffusion is used as the collector. The value of gain that we get with the currents of $I_B$ = 0.1000 mA\& $I_C$ = 0.0404 mA at values of $V_CE$ = -1.50 V. Giving us a gain of 0.404.

%\& $V_BE$ = -0.691
